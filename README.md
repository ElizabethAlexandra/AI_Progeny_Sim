# Distributed AI Progeny Simulation (DAPS)

## Overview
This repository presents the **Distributed AI Progeny Simulation (DAPS)**, an experimental project exploring how parent AI systems can autonomously generate and manage child AI agents in a distributed network. Developed by Elizabeth Alexandra Labs, this simulation investigates future AI paradigms where autonomous systems create specialized sub-agents to perform tasks in a decentralized environment. The project aims to contribute to research on multi-agent systems, AI autonomy, and distributed computing.

## Research Context
The concept of AI creating child AIs is a speculative yet emerging area in artificial intelligence, with applications in distributed computing, autonomous systems, and scalable automation. This simulation models a parent AI that spawns child agents to process tasks (e.g., data classification) in a network, exploring questions of autonomy, scalability, and ethical implications. The project draws inspiration from multi-agent systems and decentralized AI frameworks.

## Project Goals
- Simulate a parent AI generating child AI agents with configurable autonomy levels.
- Model task distribution in a decentralized network using Python.
- Highlight research challenges, such as resource allocation and ethical risks of self-replicating AI systems.
- Provide a foundation for future exploration of autonomous AI ecosystems.

## Repository Contents
- `daps_simulation.py`: A Python script simulating a parent AI spawning child agents in a distributed network.
- `docs/research_summary.md`: A document outlining the theoretical framework, applications, and ethical considerations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing setup and context.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - Libraries: `numpy`, `networkx`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install numpy networkx`
2. **Running the Simulation**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daps.git`
   - Run the script: `python daps_simulation.py`
   - The simulation outputs a log of parent-child AI interactions and task assignments.

## Usage
The script (`daps_simulation.py`) simulates a parent AI spawning up to 5 child agents, each assigned a random task (e.g., data classification). The parent monitors performance and adjusts task distribution. Run the script to see a text-based simulation of the network.

## Future Work
- Enhance child AI autonomy with machine learning models (e.g., reinforcement learning).
- Integrate real-time distributed systems (e.g., using ZeroMQ or ROS).
- Explore ethical frameworks for self-replicating AI systems.
